# Detailed UI Description for NAME Mobile App

We have designed the UI for our NAME mobile app using a sleek, modern black and light grey color scheme. Below is a detailed description of every screen, component, and interaction:

---

## 1. Splash Screen

- **Visuals & Branding:**  
  Our splash screen covers the entire display with a solid black background. In the center, our animated logo GIF is shown against a contrasting light grey backdrop or subtly blended into the overall black theme. This immediate visual impact sets a sleek, modern tone for the app.

- **Transition:**  
  The splash screen gently fades into the home screen after a brief display period, ensuring a smooth and polished transition.

## 2. Home Screen

- **Header Section:**  
  At the top of the home screen, a fixed header with a black background features our app title in light grey text, alongside a small version of our logo. The contrast is high to ensure readability.

- **Navigation Bar:**  
  We use a bottom navigation bar with a black background. Icons and labels in light grey provide access to:
  - **Upload Document:** Opens the document upload interface.
  - **Chat:** Directs users to the messaging interface.
  - **Agent Settings:** Opens the screen for configuring the AI agent.
  - **Profile/Info:** Provides access to account settings and support.
  
- **Main Content Area:**  
  The content area is set on a light grey background, creating a clear visual separation from the header and navigation bar. Here, we display:
  - **Quick Action Buttons:** Prominent buttons with black backgrounds and light grey text allow users to quickly initiate a new chat or upload a document.
  - **Recent Activity:** A scrollable list shows recent interactions or uploaded document previews in card-style layouts, using light grey cards on a black or dark background for contrast.
  - **Notifications:** Subtle badges in light grey alert users to new messages or updates.

## 3. Document Upload Screen

- **File Selection Interface:**  
  The upload screen maintains our black and light grey theme. The background is black with light grey text instructions, and the “Select File” button is styled in light grey with bold black text, making it highly visible.

- **Instructions & Feedback:**  
  Clear, concise instructions in light grey detail which file types are accepted. A progress indicator, using contrasting colors (light grey progress bar on a black background), shows upload and processing status.

- **Confirmation:**  
  Once a file is successfully processed, a confirmation message in light grey appears on the black background, clearly indicating the number of text chunks generated.

## 4. Chat Interface

- **Chat Log:**  
  The chat screen is designed to mirror popular messaging apps with a dark aesthetic:
  - **Message Bubbles:** 
    - User messages appear on the right with light grey bubbles against a black background.
    - AI responses appear on the left in slightly darker grey bubbles for differentiation.
  - **Timestamps:** Displayed in subtle light grey beneath each message.
  
- **Input Area:**  
  A fixed input area at the bottom features:
  - A text field with a black background and light grey placeholder text.
  - A send button styled in light grey with bold black text, ensuring easy visibility and a consistent look.

- **Interactive Feedback:**  
  The interface smoothly scrolls new messages into view and uses minimal animations in light grey to signal message sending and receipt.

## 5. Agent Configuration Screen

- **Personalization Options:**  
  In the Agent Settings screen, the background remains black with light grey text.
  
- **Components:**  
  - **Name Input Field:** A centrally placed text box on a light grey background with black text allows users to enter or update the AI agent’s name.
  - **Toggle/Slider Controls:** Light grey toggles or sliders with black accents let users adjust personality traits or operational parameters.
  - **Save Button:** A prominent light grey “Save” button with black text confirms changes. Visual feedback (a subtle animation) indicates a successful update.

- **User Guidance:**  
  Tooltips or brief descriptions in light grey provide additional instructions against the black background.

## 6. Settings and Support Section

- **General Settings:**  
  This section uses a black background with light grey text. Options for theme switching, notification settings, and account details are clearly laid out.
  
- **Help & Documentation:**  
  A help section with links in light grey guides users to FAQs and support pages.

  If applicable, a user profile area shows account information in a clean, light grey layout against the black background.

- **Responsiveness:**  
  Our layout adapts seamlessly across various Android device sizes, with elements resizing to maintain readability.

  High contrast between black and light grey enhances readability. Font sizes and button dimensions are optimized for ease of use.
  
- **Navigation & Transitions:**
